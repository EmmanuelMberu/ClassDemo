<h1>NEWS</h1>
James Chester continues to gain match fitness after appearing for our U23s on Monday, while Henri Lansbury misses out due to an ankle injury.<br>

Jonathan Kodjia has been in full training while wearing a protective mask after suffering a cheekbone fracture, and could be involved.<br>

Matt Targett started in the 3-1 win at Brighton & Hove Albion in midweek, announcing his return to full fitness.<br>
"Burnley have started well. I watched them at Arsenal before we played them and they gave a really good account of themselves.

"Like ourselves, they pushed them all the way and could have got something out of that game.

"They've got a lot of threats and they're very good at what they do.

"The two frontmen have scored some good goals so far this season. We'll need to be on our toes in order to look after them.

"Burnley are organised and established now. They've been in Europe and belong in the top-flight."<br>

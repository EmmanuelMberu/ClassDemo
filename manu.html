<h1>NEWS</h1>
 
Manchester United’s fourth-round Carabao Cup draw with Chelsea means the Reds will face four away games in just 10 days at the end of October and start of November.

United secured our spot in the next round of the cup competition after eliminating Rochdale on Wednesday night on penalties, and the subsequent tie at Stamford Bridge means we will play four back-to-back games on the road.

The spell begins after the home clash with Liverpool, when we travel to Partizan Belgrade on Thursday 24 October in our third match of the Europa League group stage, three days before we make the journey to Norwich to take on Daniel Farke’s Canaries.
After that fixture in East Anglia, we’re back in cup action when we travel to Stamford Bridge in the Carabao Cup clash, which looks set to take place on either 29 or 30 October, before we end our four-game away run at Bournemouth for a 12:30 BST kick-off on Saturday 2 November.

Asked immediately after the Carabao Cup draw on Wednesday about the schedule, Ole was already aware of the upcoming four-game run.
“It slots nicely into a couple of weeks with lots of travelling,” he told MUTV, smiling. “That’s how it is. We’ve got to make the best out of it, and I’m sure we will, because that’s the type of group this is and that’s the type of club we are.”

The run also means, following Monday’s Premier League game with Arsenal, six of the Reds’ next seven games will be away from home, including the upcoming trips to AZ Alkmaar and Newcastle United in the first week of October.

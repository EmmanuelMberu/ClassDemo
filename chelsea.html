<h1>NEWS</h1>
The young defender, who is impressing for Chelsea in recent weeks, had a loan spell with this weekend’s opponents a couple of years ago. He is shown on the cover celebrating his wonder strike against Wolves.

Inside there is Frank Lampard's regular manager’s column. He tells supporters: ‘We’ll be looking to sustain some of the good things we saw in the Liverpool performance last weekend, as well as the good feeling we got from the Grimsby display, and channel that into a strong league showing this afternoon.’ Buy the programme to read the rest of the boss’s message.
 
 One of Lampard’s assistants, Chris Jones, recounts his long journey from joining the Academy in 2006 to being an assistant coach with the senior set-up in 2019.

The In His Own Words feature has Mateo Kovacic opening up about growing up in Austria, why a broken leg was one of the best things that ever happened to him, and how he is maturing as a footballer.

And in Stargazing, former Chelsea player Gary Chivers talks about the time he marked the legendary Johan Cruyff.

On a similar note, Journey Home recounts the story of Allan Harris's time at Barcelona as assistant to Terry Venables. It's a great story, well worth a read, and it includes a great tale about Diego Maradona!
 James, Marc Guehi, Tino Anjorin and Ian Maatsen all made their Chelsea debuts in the 7-1 thrashing of Grimsby, while Billy Gilmour was given his first start and Hudson-Odoi was back in the team after five months out injured.

When you consider Mason Mount, Fikayo Tomori and Tammy Abraham were all unused substitutes having starred in the league this term, it’s no surprise Lampard believes the current crop of youngsters are the most talented since he has been at the club.

‘The fact we’re seeing the numbers of them in the first team speaks for itself,’ the boss said at his press conference today.

‘It’s a nice sign, it feels nice, we’re all happy at the club. They all seem comfortable, but there will be lots of things for them to learn fast. They’re confident lads, good players, they’ve been brought up the right way in a footballing sense and a life sense. They have every base needed but now it’s up to them.

‘As always with these things, even though the step into the first team feels like the hard one, it’s actually the easiest one. For me now the next step for them is sustaining, improving, and really showing at this level you are players capable of taking Chelsea to where we want to be.’
‘A huge part of my job is to work with the players, not just tactically, but in their minds. Of course with the younger players you want to pass on more knowledge, help, and be there for them in whatever way.

‘Sometimes it’s being tough. That’s my job to sense the right moment. I try and do that as much as I can. I want the players to know that’s there. In many ways, I am only as strong as the coaching staff we have.

‘Neil Bath and Jim Fraser in the Academy have got a lot of recognition this week which has been a long time coming, because their work has been going on for a lot of years. The good ethics of these players coming through is a huge credit to them. Now myself and us as staff have to continue that good work at this level.’

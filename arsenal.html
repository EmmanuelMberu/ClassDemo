<h3>Unai Emery has hailed Granit Xhaka’s leadership qualities after confirming the midfielder as our new club captain.</h3>

The Switzerland international has taken the armband six times already this season, and will be supported by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Hector Bellerin, Alexandre Lacazette, and Mesut Ozil as fellow members of the leadership group.

So why does Emery feel that Xhaka is the best man for the job?

“First, he is mature and he has experience and we are all living all the time under pressure, under criticism as coaches, as players, as a club,” our head coach said. “The most important thing is to stand up in each moment, go ahead and [for him] to show his quality, with his behaviour, with his commitment and in the dressing room the players voted for him as the first. 

“After, I spoke with him and we want to change that opinion outside because that respect that he has inside the dressing room is very, very important. And also keep moving ahead, playing, improving, and with behaviour, and his commitment. Each match for him, for me, for everybody, is a very good opportunity to show our capacity. 

“I trust and believe in him and he is a good man, a good professional and a good player. Sometimes he has made a mistake, yes, but the most important thing is to analyse, to learn and to correct that in the future. 

“His challenge, and our challenge, is to change that opinion and above all, show personality and improve in each match and give us his help every time. The first match is on Monday at Manchester United.”

<h3>It was a significant night on Tuesday as we welcomed Hector Bellerin and Rob Holding back into first-team action - while Kieran Tierney made his debut.</h3>
ll three made a big impression as we beat Nottingham Forest - and Unai Emery praised the trio and believes they will make a big impact.

"It’s amazing news," our head coach said. "It was amazing to see the people’s reaction to Rob Holding, Kieran Tierney and Hector Bellerin, who played his first 15 minutes [at the end]. 

"It was a great moment. We can be a better competitive team with them. For us having every player available is the perfect moment. 

"Now we have two injuries with Lacazette and Smith Rowe, and hopefully in a few weeks he can be training with the possibility to play. Really we are really happy with Hector, Rob and Kieran."

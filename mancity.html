The Frenchman recently returned from a long-term knee injury and made three appearances in the space of eight days.

His brief cameo away at Shakhtar was his first taste of action in five months, and that was quickly followed by 45 minutes against Watford and half an hour in the Carabao Cup win at Preston. 

He has looked excellent so far but faces competition from both Oleksandr Zinchenko and Angelino for a left-back berth, a situation replicated right across every position in the City squad, which is hailed by many as one of the strongest in Europe. 

Mendy says the depth of options we have is a positive but admits he doesn’t envy Guardiola having to pick a side from such an illustrious squad of players.

“We know this team has players in all the positions," he said.

"It’s not easy for the staff and the manager sometimes to say, “this guy plays”. All the players deserve to play, but we know how we need to work in training and after all the players respect the manager’s choice and we know he puts the best team on the pitch at the weekend.

"All our players work hard to be the best team.

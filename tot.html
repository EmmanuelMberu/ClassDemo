<h1>NEWS</h1>
Moussa Sissoko believes he’s grown as a player and a person during his time at Spurs.

The France international midfielder first joined us from Newcastle United in 2016 but found top form hard to come by in his early stages with us as he looked to settle into our style.

That all changed, however, with a stand-out season in 2018/19. Running games from central midfield, Moussa made 44 appearances in all competitions, including 10 on our epic journey to the Champions League Final, where he started against Liverpool in Madrid.

After continuing those positive individual displays into the current campaign, Moussa has been rewarded with a new contract until 2023 – something he says he can draw great encouragement from...
Moussa: “Of course, I’m very proud to sign a new deal with the Club – that means the Club believes in me and they’re happy with what I’m doing, so hopefully I can give my best to the Club for a long time and hopefully we can get some trophies all together.”
Moussa: “I try to be. I have a lot of experience. I’m 30 years old now and I’ve seen many things in football so if I can teach some new signings and even some players who have been at the Club a long time, I’m trying to do it. I think it will be helpful for everyone and if I can give them some advice, it will be no problem with me. When I was young, I had some advice from some other players and it’s always important to learn something from the experienced players, so that’s what I’m trying to do. It will be helpful for everyone because we are all together in the same boat and we want success all together so you need to have the right person next to you.”

The experienced Portuguese midfielder believes his side deserved more than their last-gasp equaliser against Crystal Palace last Sunday, and although the team are yet to claim all three points from a league game in the current campaign, they are not panicking due to improved performances ahead of the Hornet’s visit to Molineux on Saturday afternoon.

On the challenge of Watford

“It’s a tough game. We don’t see it as revenge because we beat them after the FA Cup away, it was important.

“It’s a different season, different things. They are not in a good position, we are one position higher. It’s an important game for both teams – we know that, we try to work hard this week to be prepared for the game.

“We’re going to try to win, but it’s a good team with good players, but in our home we want to give the supporters a win.”

On Molineux support

“It’s very important, not just in this couple of months. We have these games in front, but at Molineux it’s important to win in front of our supporters.

“The other games matter too, but we focus on the next game. We need to focus on Watford and go out with a good result.”

On importance of last-minute draw

“It’s very important for us. I think we deserved more because we did a very good first-half, we created opportunities, we didn’t score but we played very well and controlled the game. After the first minute of the first-half they scored with a bit of luck, but that’s the game, that’s football.

“We try to equalise, after we had one man less, but we try and try again with the same spirit. That’s what we can take from that game, the spirit we have and equalising in the last minute. It’s good for us, we try to keep the spirit for the next game.

“Because of the spirit, we try and work very hard. Crystal Palace are a good team, a team that wants to play, but with one extra player they tried to keep the ball. We try to press, we try to create opportunities and in the last minute I think we deserved the luck we had to score.”

On team spirit helping results

“The most important thing is that we keep trying and we keep working hard like we do all the week and I think the results are getting better. 

“We can’t panic, because we want to win. We don’t win, but we don’t lose much; we lose two, but we draw four. The next game is a tough game, but we have the capacity to win.

“That’s what we try every week, we have training sessions to be better, to develop our team and do our best to win, but sometimes it’s not always possible.”

On balancing competitions

“It’s good. It’s a bit more difficult because the coach needs to manage the players; it’s not the same if we play Saturday to Saturday. You have more days to recover then and more days to work for the game and with the Europa you can’t. You need to recover and play after two to three days. That’s what we do; we adapt, we try to do our best.

“For me, all the players want to play in more competitions. We try to compete, but we know our priority is the Premier League.

“We are players; we try to give everything in all the games, but we know it’s not always possible. In the Europa League, we didn’t win the first one [against Braga], but we try to win the next one.”
